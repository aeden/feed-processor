Feed Processor is a multi-stage feed processor built with JRuby, MRI, beanstalk and MongoDB.

There are two steps to the feed processing:

# Step 1: Download feed content using non-blocking IO and insert the raw data into MongoDB. A message is sent via Beanstalk notifying the parser stage that the feed data is ready for a specific feed.
# Step 2: A multi-processor feed parser pulls the raw data from MongoDB, parses it and inserts the resulting parsed record into MongoDB.
